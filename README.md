## ðŸ“ˆ Stock Price Prediction with PyTorch LSTM

This project demonstrates how to predict stock prices using a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model implemented in PyTorch. The workflow includes:

- Data collection and preprocessing
- Model architecture design
- Training and evaluation
- Performance metrics

The dataset used comprises historical stock prices, and the model aims to forecast future price trends.
